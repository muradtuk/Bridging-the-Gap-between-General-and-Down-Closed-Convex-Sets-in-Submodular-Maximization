* This work introduces novel offline and online algorithms for maximizing non-monotone DR-submodular functions over general convex constraints, using a natural decomposition of the constraint set into a down-closed and a general convex body, enabling a provable smooth interpolation between constraint types and outperforming prior methods in empirical evaluations.


In this repository, we present our submodular maximization optimization code (tested with Python 3.11).
